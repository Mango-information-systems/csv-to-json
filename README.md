##About

Here is some background about the project.

This converter was built with two purpose:

* be used internally,
* experiment with the development of an offline-friendly HTML5 web app.

At time of creation of the app the website of Mango Information Systems was about to be fully rebuild from scratch using another technology architecture, meaning this tool would probably be re-written soon.

With this in mind, priority has been put on **getting things done** rather than elegance of the architecture.

The CSV parser used is however cleaner and includes test, cf. [papaParse](https://github.com/mholt/PapaParse).
